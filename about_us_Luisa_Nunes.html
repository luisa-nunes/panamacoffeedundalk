            <h1>An all day celebration of <strong>Latin American Culture</strong> in an Irish culture.</h1>
            <p>We opened Panama Coffee, the first Coffee Shop in Dundalk in 2012, we wanted to bring the most exquisite coffee and cultural experience to a market that by then was unknown.
            We both had financial knowledge background but when we started  this new adventure we needed to study, learn and make some mistakes in our learning process.</p>
            
            <p>Our passion for coffee and excellent service was and is still today the slogan that motivate us to run our business. We love what we do and we try to pass it on to our staff and treat our clients with love and respect, in other words as part of Panama Coffee family.</p>
            
            <p>Our mission is to provide the best coffee to our customers together with a touch of Panamanian cultural, in an environment where they are part of our extended family and they can all take a break from their daily obligation any enjoying the fountain, music, coffee and the food.</p>
            
            <p>We are both passionate about making the coffee experience as enjoyable as possible for everyone who has a hand in it, from growers to roasters to baristas, all the way through to the customer. We both recognize that coffee does not just grow on trees. Every coffee experience starts and ends with the best fruit; Panama Coffee believe in thoughtfully sourcing only the best varieties and supporting the farmers who harvest the coffee we love.
            </p>
